🚀 Check out my interactive Snake Game 🐍🎮 🚀

I’ve developed a fun, fast-paced Snake Game entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With responsive design, dynamic speed controls, and smooth gameplay, it's a great demonstration of interactive web development.

👾 Key Features:

Fully responsive layout for desktop & mobile
Real-time speed adjustments (Slow, Medium, Fast)
Interactive controls with arrow keys or buttons
Unique snake movement with gradient effects
Game Over screen with visual feedback
Whether you're a game development enthusiast or a fellow web developer, this is a great way to explore how HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript come together for fun and engaging web-based games. 🎮
